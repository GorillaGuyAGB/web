        <h3>Here are Colorado Locals favorite mountains!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Arapahoe Basin Ski Area</li>
            <p>Located right off of Loveland Pass, Arapahoe Basin offers great 
                expert terrain skiing. This mountain has 1428 acres of accesible 
                terrain, and is my personal favorite.
            </p>

            <li>Monarch Mountain</li>
            <p>If you're in it for the backcountry,
                then Monarch Mountain is just for you! With 670 acres of lift
                accesible terrain and 1,600+ of backcountry terrain, this mountain
                is definitely the one for those backcountry go-getters!
            </p>
            <img src="monarch.jpg" width="300px" height="300px">
            <li>Echo Mountain</li>
            <p>If you are looking for a budget friendly mountain that isn't to far from
                Denver than Echo Mountain is for you! Echo Mountain has roughly 60 acres 
                of skiable terrain. Recently, the mountain had a change in ownership and
                this shifted the ideology of the mountain to family-friendly oriented. 
                Certainly the mountain if  you are looking for a quick trip!
